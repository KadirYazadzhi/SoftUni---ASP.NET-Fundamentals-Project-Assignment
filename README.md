## 🌟 Key Features

### 🛒 Auction System
* **Dynamic Listings:** Users can create auctions with start time, end time, and starting price.
* **Smart Bidding:**

### 💰 Financial Ecosystem (Wallet)

### 🛡️ Administration Area

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **Registration:** User creates an account via ASP.NET Identity.
2.  **Deposit:** User adds virtual funds to their Wallet via the "Deposit" action.
3.  **Bid:**
    * User places a bid on an item.
    * System checks `AvailableBalance`.
    * Funds are moved to `HeldBalance` (Escrow).
    * Previous highest bidder gets their funds refunded instantly.
4.  **Win:**
    * Auction timer expires (handled by `AuctionCleanupService`).
    * Winner's held funds are transferred to the Seller.
    * Ownership of the item is transferred.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The solution uses a **Monolithic Architecture** with clear separation of concerns, following the **Service-Repository Pattern**.

* **Presentation Layer:** ASP.NET MVC (Controllers & Views).
* **Service Layer:** Business logic resides here (e.g., `AuctionService`, `WalletService`). This makes the code testable and reusable.
* **Data Layer:** Entity Framework Core with SQL Server.
* **Background Services:**
    * `AuctionCleanupService`: A hosted service (`IHostedService`) that runs in the background to automatically close expired auctions and process transfers.

## 💾 Database Schema

The database relies on strong relationships to ensure data integrity.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ApplicationUser ||--o{ Auction : "Creates"
    ApplicationUser ||--o{ Bid : "Places"
    ApplicationUser ||--o{ Transaction : "Has"
    ApplicationUser ||--o{ Notification : "Receives"
    
    Auction ||--o{ Bid : "Contains"
    Auction }|--|| Category : "In"
    
    Bid }|--|| ApplicationUser : "By"
    
    Transaction {
        string Type "Deposit/Withdraw/Hold"
        decimal Amount
        datetime Date
    }
